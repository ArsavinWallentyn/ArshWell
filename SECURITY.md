## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you’ve found a security issue in ArshWell, please use the following procedure
instead of the normal bug reporting system. Instead of using the bug tracker,
mailing list or IRC please send a DM to the owner of this repo:
- Discord: Arshavin#8902 user;
- Instagram: [/arsavinel](https://www.instagram.com/arsavinel/) account.

For each report, we try to first confirm the vulnerability. Once confirmed,
the ArshWell team will take the following actions:

1. Acknowledge to the reporter that we’ve received the issue, and are
   working on a fix;
   - We ask that the reporter **keep the issue confidential** until we announce it.
2. Get a fix/patch prepared;
3. Prepare a post describing the vulnerability, and the possible exploits;
4. Release new versions of all affected versions;
5. Prominently feature the problem in the release announcement.
